## Top Repositories

Here are some of the top repositories I've worked on:

- [EmployeeConnector](https://github.com/Radscribe-1/EmployeeConnector) - An attendance management application that tracks employee attendance, manages shifts, and records leave data. I contributed by implementing new features to enhance user experience, including improved reporting, notifications, and integration with existing HR systems.

- [Radspeakai-server](https://github.com/Radscribe-1/Radspeakai-server) - The server-side component of a Python project focused on real-time transcription of system audio. This application transcribes audio input to text in real time, and I worked on developing the backend server that processes and streams audio data for transcription.

- [EmployeeConnector v2](https://github.com/Radscribe/360frontendnew.git) - An advanced version of the attendance management application, introducing enhanced reporting, real-time notifications, and seamless integration with HR systems. In this version, I contributed by optimizing performance, implementing role-based access control (RBAC), improving shift management, and adding automated leave approval workflows to streamline HR operations.
